# Welcome in my project!

Hi! My name is Błażej Raducki. I just defended my master's degree at Wroclaw University of Technology, hence I lacked a little time to finalize everything you recommended ;) I think I would have tackled all the tasks, and the ones I managed to do I checked carefully (at the bottom I will describe what I did). Due to the upcoming Euro finals and from what I understood the deadline for tomorrow morning (i.e. 15.07) I leave the project as it is.

# How to run project

### `npm run start`

maybe it will be also usefull:

### `npm install`

## My Node and Npm version

### `Node: 18.17.1`

### `Npm: 6.14.4`

## Implemented

- All main aims (there is a chance that I misunderstood any of the commands, which I am able to clarify)
- I made JSON file called "messages" (front\src\data\messages.json)
- I didn't use any bootstrap
- I made whole styling in scss
- I made my project responsive

**Additional advantages:**

- Embedding the entire task in some JS framework (preferably Angular).
  > Done in React
- No image files in the final design (no jpg, gif, png, svg type files).
  > Not done :( I'm wondering how You made this HTML5 logo without png
- CSS IS AWESOME in the footer - when the mouse hovers, the frame (without text) should do an animated rotation.
  > Done
- Application of BEM.
  > When it was convenient for me I used
- Meeting the rules of a11y.
  > I cautioned
- Logical use of rem, em, vh, vw units (in effect, as little use of px unit as possible) - in such a way that responsiveness is met with as little code as possible.
  > Done, sometimes there are px but only low value
- Mobile first.
  > Done
- When docking content, make the content alphabetically sorted in the last block.
  > Done
- When pasting the content, if the condition for it to be unique cannot be met, display an appropriate message (e.g. alert/dialog/modal).
  > Done with notistack
- Button in the footer ("show") to eject the frame without using JS.
  > Not done :(
- Upload the result of the work to preview on some free platform (e.g. netlify/heroku).
  > Not done, but I tried...

I also didn't make "exercice for 6" however I know how to do that... But Euro final...

## Comments

I tried my best to reproduce the design from the graphics, but a "skilled eye" will probably pick up minor differences, for which I apologize.

Finally, some more thoughts occurred to me:

- I should write colors as variables
- use Angular instead of React, you would probably look at me more pleasantly ;)
